    <h1>Features of NetBSD</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>NetBSD is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system. 
    It is available for many platforms, from 64-bit x86 servers and PC desktop systems to embedded 
    ARM- and MIPS- based devices. Its clean design and advanced features make it excellent in both production 
    and research environments, and it is user-supported with complete source. Many applications are easily 
    available through pkgsrc, the NetBSD Packages Collection.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Code quality and correctness</li>
        <li>Portability to a wide range of hardware</li>
        <li>Secure defaults</li>
        <li>Adherence to industry standards</li>
        <li>Research and innovation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supported Platforms</h2>
    <p>NetBSD supports many platforms, including the popular i386 and amd64, ARM, SPARC, Alpha, Amiga, Atari, and
    m68k- and PowerPC-based Apple Macintosh machines.</p>

    <h2>Applications for NetBSD</h2>
    <p>Aside from the standard Unix productivity tools, editors, formatters, C/C++ compilers and debuggers, and so on, 
    that are included with the base system, there is a huge collection of packages (currently over 20,000) that can be 
    installed as binary packages or built from pkgsrc, including popular software such as Firefox, 
    PostgreSQL, Python, and Xfce.</p>
